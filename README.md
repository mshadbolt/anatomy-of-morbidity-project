# Deciphering the Anatomy of Morbidity in Canada 

The HackSeq18 Anatomy of Morbidity project space.

## Mission
Everyone — corporations, governments, individuals — has data, but few people know how to use it effectively. Data can tell us much about how to make better decisions, but often this knowledge is hidden within the numbers. In this hackathon, we will be using Vital Statistics open data that's available in the form of large unstructured statistics into user-friendly, dynamic, and interactive plots and maps.

## Abstract

Since 2016, the world has been implementing United Nation's Agenda for Sustainable Development, by addressing urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. 
This mandate is undertaken differently in various countries. In Canada, data on deaths and causes of death are collected by the Canadian Vital Statistics and released as a 'Death Database'. This database is an administrative survey that collects demographic and medical (cause of death) information annually from all provincial vital statistics registries on all deaths in Canada.
The problem with the existing open datasets, however, are that they are too large and the categories are not well defined nor useful for non-data experts. 
Our hypothesis-driven solution enables interactive visualizations so that the information within the databases are more readily accessible, user-friendly, and interactive. We employ the free and open-source integrated development environment for R as part of our workflow to categorize diseases based on gender and age in time. This data is then summarized in the form of static and dynamic plots as well as interactive maps.
