2,"Death refers to the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after a live birth has taken place. Stillbirths are excluded."
3,"The number of deaths in this table is based on the deceased's usual place of residence."
4,"Counts in this table exclude deaths of non-residents of Canada."
5,"For data year 2000 to 2009, missing data on sex of the deceased were imputed based on death registration number. Starting with 2010 data year, missing data on sex of the deceased were imputed based on the cause of death information and a logistic regression."
6,"Age attained at the last birthday preceding death."
7,"For ""Age at time of death, all ages"", the mortality rate represents the crude death rate or the number of deaths during a given year per 100,000 population as of July 1 of the same year."
8,"For ""Age at time of death, under 1 year"", mortality rate calculation uses live births in calendar year instead of the under one year of age population, except for 2012 where the mortality rate is based on the estimated population under one year of age."
9,"For ""Age at time of death, 1 to 4 years"", mortality rate calculation uses population estimates for 0 to 4 year olds less live births in calendar year, except for 2012 where the mortality rate for 1 to 4 year olds is based on the population estimate for this age group."
10,"For ""Age at time of death"", each age group except ""All ages"", the mortality rate represents the age-specific death rate or the number of deaths in a particular age group during a given year per 100,000 population in the same age group as of July 1 of the same year."
11,"The cause of death tabulated is the underlying cause of death. This is defined as (a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury. The underlying cause is selected from the conditions listed on the medical certificate of cause of death."

27,"The totals (all causes of death) by age group and/ or sex presented in this table may not reflect those given in CANSIM tables 102-0501 to 102-0510, 102-0030 due to the correction of age or sex information that was inconsistent with the underlying cause of death."
28,"For reference years 2000 to 2009, the age-specific mortality rates for the category ""Both sexes"" have been corrected. The correction affects only the rates for the following 9 sex-specific grouped causes of death: Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri [C53], Malignant neoplasms of corpus uteri and uterus, part unspecified [C54-C55], Malignant neoplasm of ovary [C56], Malignant neoplasm of prostate [C61], Hyperplasia of prostate [N40], Inflammatory diseases of female pelvic organs [N70-N76], Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium [O00-O99], Pregnancy with abortive outcome [O00-O07] and Other complications of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium [O10-O99]. Prior to the correction, the rates for these 9 groups were calculated using either the male or female population; the corrected values use the combined male-female population, making them consistent with the 2010 and 2011 rates."
29,"During the production of each year's birth/death/stillbirth statistics, data from previous years may be revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the provincial and territorial vital statistics registrars."
