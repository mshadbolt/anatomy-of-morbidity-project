Additionally, studies on prevalence and patterns of causes of morbidity or co-morbidity and associated determinants in Canada remain scarce and outdated [4]. Since 2016, the world has been implementing the United Nation’s Agenda for Sustainable Development by addressing urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. This mandate is undertaken differently in various countries. In Canada, data on deaths and causes of death are collected by the Canadian Vital Statistics and released as a ‘Death Database’. This database is an administrative survey that collects demographic and medical (cause of death) information annually from all provincial vital statistics registries on all deaths in Canada. The problem with the existing open datasets, however, is that they are too large and the categories are not well defined nor useful for non-data experts. Our hypothesis-driven solution enables interactive visualizations so that the information within the databases are more readily accessible, user-friendly, and interactive. We employ the free and open-source integrated development environment for R as part of our workflow to categorize diseases based on gender and age in time. This data is imported, cleaned up, and summarized in the form of static and dynamic plots as well as interactive maps. We hope that understanding the major causes of mortality (i.e. various diseases) among males and females in different age categories across all provinces can inform healthcare and government policies. In this project, we formulate hypotheses about what we most die of as a nation and test them by exploring these datasets. 2.1 Rationale Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is easier than poring over large spreadsheets or reports. Data visualization is a quick and easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner. When we formulate questions and explore answers by slightly adjusting different scenarios interactively with plots, we can make evidence-informed decisions quicker and more efficiently. The hope of this project is to enable quick and inexpensive decision making for anyone who is interested. 2.2 Aims Since patterns, trends and correlations in large datasets can go undetected in text or large data sheets, we aim to use RStudio as our data visualization software to represent data in a context that enables understanding its significance.
